# Prompt Management

This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, organizing, and managing prompts in the Professional Interface.

## Understanding Prompts

### What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a structured set of instructions designed to guide AI models in generating specific types of responses. In our system, prompts consist of:

- **Metadata** - Title, summary, tags, and organizational information
- **Human-Readable Content** - Goal, audience, steps, and output expectations
- **Variables** - Placeholders for dynamic content
- **Version History** - Track of all changes and improvements

### Prompt Structure

#### Metadata
- **Title** - Descriptive name (e.g., "Email Marketing Campaign Generator")
- **Summary** - Brief description of the prompt's purpose
- **Tags** - Keywords for categorization (e.g., "marketing", "email", "copywriting")
- **Status** - Draft, Published, or Archived

#### Human-Readable Content
- **Goal** - What the prompt aims to achieve
- **Audience** - Who will use this prompt or who it's designed for
- **Steps** - Detailed instructions broken down into actionable parts
- **Output Expectations** - Format, length, and content requirements

#### Variables
- **Name** - Variable identifier (e.g., "product_name", "target_audience")
- **Description** - What this variable represents
- **Type** - String, number, boolean, or array
- **Required** - Whether the variable must be provided
- **Default Value** - Optional fallback value

### Best Practices for Prompt Creation

#### Writing Effective Instructions

**Be Specific and Clear**
```
❌ Bad: "Write something about the product"
✅ Good: "Write a 150-word product description highlighting the key benefits and target use cases"
```

**Use Action Verbs**
```
❌ Bad: "Information about pricing should be included"
✅ Good: "Include pricing information in a bulleted list format"
```

**Structure with Numbers or Bullets**
```
✅ Good:
1. Analyze the target audience demographics
2. Identify three key pain points
3. Craft a compelling headline addressing the main pain point
4. Write supporting copy with benefits and features
5. Include a clear call-to-action
```

#### Defining Variables

**Use Descriptive Names**
```
❌ Bad: var1, x, temp
✅ Good: product_name, target_audience, campaign_budget
```

**Provide Clear Descriptions**
```
✅ Good:
- product_name: The name of the product being marketed
- target_audience: Primary demographic (age, interests, profession)
- campaign_budget: Available budget in USD for the campaign
```

**Set Appropriate Types**
```
- product_name: string (required)
- campaign_budget: number (optional, default: 1000)
- include_testimonials: boolean (optional, default: true)
- key_features: array (required)
```

## Organizing Prompts

### Tagging Strategy

#### Hierarchical Tags
Use a consistent hierarchy for better organization:
```
- Category: marketing, development, content, analysis
- Type: email, blog, code, report
- Industry: healthcare, finance, education, retail
- Complexity: beginner, intermediate, advanced
```

#### Example Tag Combinations
```
- "marketing, email, healthcare, intermediate"
- "development, code-review, python, advanced"
- "content, blog-post, education, beginner"
```

### Folder-Like Organization

While the system doesn't use traditional folders, you can simulate them with tags:
```
- "team:marketing" - For marketing team prompts
- "project:q4-campaign" - For specific project prompts
- "template:standard" - For reusable templates
```

### Status Management

#### Draft Status
- Work-in-progress prompts
- Not visible to other users
- Can be edited freely
- Use for experimentation

#### Published Status
- Ready for use by others
- Visible in search results
- Can still be edited (creates new version)
- Recommended for team sharing

#### Archived Status
- No longer actively used
- Hidden from default searches
- Preserved for historical reference
- Can be restored if needed

## Editing and Versioning

1. **Open the prompt** you want to edit
2. **Click "Edit"** button
3. **Make your changes** in the editor

### Version History

Every change creates a new version with:
- **Timestamp** - When the change was made

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Prompt Not Saving

- **Verify permissions** - Ensure you have edit rights
- **Check network connection** - Save requires internet
- **Try refreshing** the page and trying again

### Can't Find Prompt
- **Check filters** - May be filtered out
- **Verify status** - Might be in draft or archived
- **Search variations** - Try different keywords
- **Check spelling** in search terms

### Version History Missing
- **Refresh the page** - History loads separately
- **Check permissions** - May not have access to history
- **Contact admin** - If history appears corrupted

### Performance Issues
- **Clear browser cache** - Old data may cause slowdowns
