## System Overview

### Architecture Components

The Prompt Library Professional Interface consists of several key components:

- **Frontend Application** - React-based web interface
- **Backend API Server** - Node.js/Express REST API
- **Database** - PostgreSQL for user data and metadata
- **File Storage** - File system for prompt storage
- **Cache Layer** - Redis for session management and caching
- **Reverse Proxy** - Nginx for load balancing and SSL termination
- **Monitoring Stack** - Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for observability

### Deployment Options

#### Docker Compose (Recommended)
- Complete stack deployment
- Easy configuration management
- Automatic service orchestration
- Built-in monitoring and logging

#### Kubernetes
- Scalable production deployment
- High availability configuration
- Advanced networking and security
- Automated scaling and recovery

#### Manual Installation
- Custom deployment scenarios
- Legacy system integration
- Development environments
- Specialized configurations

## Quick Start for Administrators

### Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure you have:

- **Docker and Docker Compose** (v20.10+)
- **Minimum 4GB RAM** and 20GB disk space
- **SSL certificates** for production deployment
- **Domain name** configured with DNS
- **Backup storage** location configured

### Basic Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd prompt-library-interface
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Initialize database**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend npm run db:migrate
   docker-compose exec backend npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Create admin user**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend npm run create-admin
   ```

### Initial Configuration

After installation, complete these essential configuration steps:

1. **Access admin panel** at `https://your-domain/admin`
2. **Configure system settings** (storage, caching, security)
3. **Set up monitoring** and alerting
4. **Configure backup** procedures
5. **Test all functionality** with sample data

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, User, Viewer)
- **Session management** with Redis storage
- **Password policies** with complexity requirements
- **Multi-factor authentication** support (optional)

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at rest** for sensitive data (API keys, credentials)
- **Encryption in transit** with TLS 1.3
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection protection** with parameterized queries
- **XSS protection** with Content Security Policy

### Network Security

- **Reverse proxy** with security headers
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **IP whitelisting** for admin access
- **Firewall configuration** recommendations
- **VPN integration** for secure access

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### System Health
- **CPU and memory usage** across all services
- **Disk space** and I/O performance
- **Network connectivity** and latency
- **Service availability** and response times

#### Application Metrics
- **API response times** and error rates
- **User authentication** success/failure rates
- **Prompt operations** (create, edit, delete, enhance)
- **LLM provider** connectivity and performance

#### Business Metrics
- **Active users** and session duration
- **Prompt library growth** and usage patterns
- **Enhancement workflow** success rates
- **Export and sharing** activity

### Alerting Rules

Configure alerts for:
- **Service downtime** (immediate)
- **High error rates** (>5% for 5 minutes)
- **Resource exhaustion** (>90% CPU/memory/disk)
- **Authentication failures** (>10 failed attempts/minute)
- **LLM provider issues** (connection failures)

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy

#### Daily Backups
- **Database dump** with full schema and data
- **Prompt files** with incremental sync
- **Configuration files** and certificates
- **User uploads** and generated content

#### Weekly Backups
- **Full system snapshot** for disaster recovery
- **Log archives** for compliance and debugging
- **Monitoring data** for trend analysis

#### Monthly Backups
- **Long-term archival** to cold storage
- **Compliance documentation** and audit trails
- **Performance baselines** and capacity planning data

### Recovery Procedures

#### Database Recovery
1. Stop all services
2. Restore database from backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Restart services in correct order
5. Test functionality

#### File System Recovery
1. Mount backup storage
2. Restore prompt files and uploads
3. Verify file permissions
4. Update file paths if necessary
5. Test file access

#### Full System Recovery
1. Provision new infrastructure
2. Restore configuration files
3. Restore database and files
4. Update DNS and certificates
5. Perform full system test

## Performance Optimization
