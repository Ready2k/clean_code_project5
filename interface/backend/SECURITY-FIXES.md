# Security Fixes Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and the fixes that have been implemented.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Log File Path Traversal (High Severity) ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: The log viewing API accepted unsanitized filenames, allowing path traversal attacks to read arbitrary files.

**Attack Vector**: 
```
GET /api/system/logs/files/../../../../etc/passwd
```

**Fix Implemented**:
- Created `utils/path-security.ts` with secure filename validation
- Added `validateLogFilename()` function that:
  - Removes path traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`)
  - Validates filename format (alphanumeric + allowed characters only)
  - Enforces file extension whitelist (`.log`, `.txt`)
  - Limits filename length (max 100 characters)
  - Removes null bytes and control characters
- Added `validateLogPath()` function that:
  - Uses `path.resolve()` to get absolute paths
  - Ensures resolved path stays within logs directory
  - Prevents directory escape attempts
- Updated `log-reader-service.ts` to use secure path validation
- Updated `system.ts` controller with additional filename validation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/path-security.ts` (new)
- `src/services/log-reader-service.ts`
- `src/controllers/system.ts`

### 2. Unauthenticated Log Ingestion (Medium Severity) ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Log ingestion endpoints allowed unauthenticated access, enabling log forgery and DoS attacks.

**Attack Vectors**:
```bash
# Log flooding
curl -X POST /api/v1/logs/frontend -d '{"level":"error","message":"SPAM"}'

# Log forgery
curl -X POST /api/v1/logs/frontend -d '{"level":"info","message":"Fake admin login"}'
```

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added authentication requirement using existing `authenticateToken` middleware
- Created `middleware/log-validation.ts` with comprehensive input validation:
  - Validates required fields (timestamp, level, message)
  - Sanitizes message content (removes control characters)
  - Enforces message length limits (max 2000 characters)
  - Validates log levels against whitelist
  - Limits metadata size
- Created `middleware/log-rate-limit.ts` with Redis-based rate limiting:
  - Single log endpoint: 100 requests/minute, 200 log entries/minute
  - Batch log endpoint: 20 requests/minute, 500 log entries/minute
  - Graceful fallback when Redis unavailable
  - Rate limit headers in responses
- Updated log routes to use new security middleware
- Fixed batch processing to match validation expectations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/middleware/log-validation.ts` (new)
- `src/middleware/log-rate-limit.ts` (new)
- `src/routes/logs.ts`

## Security Measures Implemented

### Input Validation
- ✅ Filename sanitization and validation
- ✅ Log message content validation
- ✅ Log level validation against whitelist
- ✅ Message length limits
- ✅ Metadata size limits
- ✅ Control character removal

### Access Control
- ✅ Authentication required for all log endpoints
- ✅ Existing permission system leveraged (`system:config` for log viewing)
- ✅ Rate limiting per authenticated user

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ Request-based rate limiting
- ✅ Log entry count-based rate limiting
- ✅ Different limits for single vs batch endpoints
- ✅ Redis-based storage with fallback handling

### Path Security
- ✅ Path traversal prevention
- ✅ Directory boundary enforcement
- ✅ File extension whitelist
- ✅ Filename character restrictions

## Testing

### Security Tests Added
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Valid filename acceptance
- Invalid character rejection
- Path boundary validation
- Rate limiting parameter validation

**Test File**: `src/__tests__/security-fixes.test.ts`

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify path traversal attempts are blocked
- [ ] Confirm valid log files are accessible
- [ ] Test authentication requirement on log endpoints
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works correctly
- [ ] Check log validation rejects malformed entries
- [ ] Confirm batch processing works with new validation

## Configuration

### Rate Limiting Settings
```typescript
// Single log entries
windowMs: 60 * 1000,     // 1 minute
maxRequests: 100,        // 100 requests per minute
maxLogEntries: 200       // 200 log entries per minute

// Batch log entries
windowMs: 60 * 1000,     // 1 minute
maxRequests: 20,         // 20 batch requests per minute
maxLogEntries: 500       // 500 log entries per minute total
```

### Validation Limits
- Message length: 2000 characters
- Filename length: 100 characters
- Metadata size: 1000 characters (serialized)
- Batch size: 50 log entries maximum

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
- Redis must be available for rate limiting (graceful fallback if not)
- Existing authentication system must be working
- Log directory must have proper permissions

### Breaking Changes
- ⚠️ **Log ingestion endpoints now require authentication**
- ⚠️ **Batch log format changed**: `{ logs: [...] }` instead of `[...]`
- ⚠️ **Stricter validation**: Invalid log entries will be rejected

### Migration Guide
For frontend applications using log ingestion:
1. Ensure authentication tokens are included in requests
2. Update batch log format to use `{ logs: [...] }` structure
3. Ensure log messages are under 2000 characters
4. Use only valid log levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`

## Monitoring

### Security Events to Monitor
- Rate limit violations (logged as warnings)
- Path traversal attempts (logged as errors)
- Authentication failures on log endpoints
- Malformed log entry rejections

### Metrics to Track
- Log ingestion rate per user
- Authentication failure rate
- Path traversal attempt frequency
- Rate limit hit frequency

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add log entry signing/verification
- [ ] Implement log retention policies
- [ ] Add structured logging validation
- [ ] Consider log compression for storage efficiency
- [ ] Add audit trail for log access

### Security Hardening
- [ ] Consider IP-based rate limiting in addition to user-based
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA for repeated violations
- [ ] Implement log integrity checking
- [ ] Add anomaly detection for unusual log patterns

## Compliance Notes

These fixes address:
- **OWASP Top 10**: A01 (Broken Access Control), A07 (Identification and Authentication Failures)
- **CWE-22**: Path Traversal
- **CWE-770**: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
- **CWE-117**: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs

The implementation follows security best practices for enterprise environments while maintaining functionality and performance.
