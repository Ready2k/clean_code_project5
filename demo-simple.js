// Simple demonstration of the intelligent question generation improvement

console.log("🚀 AI Enhancer Question Generation - Before vs After\n");

console.log("❌ BEFORE: Always asked the same 2 generic questions");
console.log("   1. What specific data or content should be processed?");
console.log("   2. Any additional context or constraints?");
console.log("   (Asked regardless of whether they were relevant or needed)\n");

console.log("✅ AFTER: Smart, context-aware questions based on task type\n");

const examples = [
  {
    task: "Self-contained explanation",
    prompt: "Explain how photosynthesis works in plants",
    before: "2 generic questions (unnecessary)",
    after: "0 questions (task is complete as-is)"
  },
  {
    task: "Vague analysis task",
    prompt: "Analyze customer feedback",
    before: "2 generic questions",
    after: "2 specific questions: 'What data should be analyzed?' + 'What aspects to focus on?'"
  },
  {
    task: "Code generation",
    prompt: "Write a sorting function",
    before: "2 generic questions",
    after: "1 specific question: 'What programming language should be used?'"
  },
  {
    task: "Content with clear requirements",
    prompt: "Generate a professional email template for customer onboarding with greeting, steps, and contact info",
    before: "2 generic questions (unnecessary)",
    after: "0 questions (requirements are already clear)"
  }
];

examples.forEach((example, i) => {
  console.log(`${i + 1}. ${example.task}`);
  console.log(`   Prompt: "${example.prompt}"`);
  console.log(`   Before: ${example.before}`);
  console.log(`   After:  ${example.after}`);
  console.log("");
});

console.log("🎯 Key Improvements:");
console.log("• Task type detection (analysis, generation, code, etc.)");
console.log("• Context awareness - no questions for complete prompts");
console.log("• Relevant questions only when actually needed");
console.log("• Task-specific questions instead of generic ones");
console.log("• Eliminates user frustration from repetitive questioning");

console.log("\n💡 Result: Users get a smoother, more intelligent experience!");
