# Test Prompt Creation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ SSR Compatibility (`ReferenceError: window is not defined`)
- Added safe browser environment checks for localStorage, window, document, navigator APIs
- Protected all browser-specific operations with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks

### 2. ✅ WebSocket CSP Error
- Updated Content Security Policy to allow WebSocket connections
- Added `ws://localhost:8000` and `wss://localhost:8000` to `connect-src` directive

### 3. ✅ Prompt Validation Error (400 Bad Request)
- Fixed frontend validation to match backend requirements:
  - **Goal**: minimum 10 characters (was missing this validation)
  - **Audience**: minimum 5 characters (was missing this validation)  
  - **Steps**: at least 1 step with minimum 1 character each

## Test Instructions

1. **Open the application**: http://localhost
2. **Click "Create Prompt"** button
3. **Fill out the form with valid data**:
   - **Title**: "Test Prompt" (any title)
   - **Summary**: "This is a test prompt for validation" (any summary)
   - **Goal**: "Create a comprehensive test that validates all functionality properly" (minimum 10 chars)
   - **Audience**: "Developers and testers" (minimum 5 chars)
   - **Steps**: Add at least one step with meaningful content
   - **Output Format**: "Structured test results" (required)

4. **Submit the form** - it should now work without 400 errors

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ No more `window is not defined` errors
- ✅ No more WebSocket CSP violations  
- ✅ No more 400 Bad Request errors on prompt creation
- ✅ Form validation shows helpful error messages for minimum length requirements
- ✅ Successful prompt creation and redirect

## Validation Messages

The form now shows helpful validation messages:
- "Goal must be at least 10 characters long"
- "Audience must be at least 5 characters long" 
- "At least one step is required"
- "Each step must have at least 1 character"
