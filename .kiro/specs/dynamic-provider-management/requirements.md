# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing dynamic LLM provider and model management within the administration interface. Currently, the system has hardcoded provider configurations (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, AWS Bedrock, Microsoft Copilot) with predefined model lists. This feature will enable system administrators to dynamically add, remove, and configure new LLM providers and their supported models through the web interface, making the system more flexible and future-proof as new AI models and providers become available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Provider Management Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage LLM providers through the admin interface so that I can add support for new AI services without requiring code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the provider management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all configured providers with their status, model count, and last updated information
2. WHEN an admin adds a new provider THEN the system SHALL require provider name, identifier, API endpoint, authentication method, and supported capabilities
3. WHEN an admin edits a provider THEN the system SHALL allow modification of all configuration parameters except the provider identifier
4. WHEN an admin deletes a provider THEN the system SHALL verify no active connections exist and archive the provider configuration
5. WHEN an admin tests a provider THEN the system SHALL validate connectivity and display available models from the provider's API
6. WHEN provider configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and update the provider registry

### Requirement 2: Model Management Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage available models for each provider so that users can access the latest AI models as they become available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin views a provider's models THEN the system SHALL display all configured models with their capabilities, context limits, and availability status
2. WHEN an admin adds a new model THEN the system SHALL require model identifier, display name, context length, supported features, and pricing tier
3. WHEN an admin updates a model THEN the system SHALL allow modification of display name, context length, capabilities, and availability status
4. WHEN an admin removes a model THEN the system SHALL check for active usage and prevent deletion if the model is currently in use
5. WHEN an admin tests a model THEN the system SHALL send a test request to verify the model is accessible and functional
6. WHEN model configuration changes THEN the system SHALL update the provider registry and notify connected users

### Requirement 3: Provider Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to validate provider configurations so that I can ensure new providers will work correctly before making them available to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider configuration is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate API endpoint accessibility and authentication credentials
2. WHEN provider capabilities are defined THEN the system SHALL verify the provider supports the claimed features (system messages, streaming, tools)
3. WHEN model information is provided THEN the system SHALL validate model identifiers against the provider's available models
4. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating what needs to be corrected
5. WHEN validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL perform a test request to confirm the provider is fully functional
6. WHEN a provider becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically update its status and notify administrators

### Requirement 4: Dynamic Provider Registry

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the provider registry to dynamically load configurations so that new providers become immediately available without system restarts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new provider is added THEN the system SHALL update the provider registry without requiring application restart
2. WHEN provider configurations change THEN the system SHALL refresh the registry cache and update all active connections
3. WHEN the registry is queried THEN the system SHALL return current provider information including dynamic configurations
4. WHEN a provider is disabled THEN the system SHALL immediately prevent new connections while allowing existing ones to complete
5. WHEN provider capabilities are updated THEN the system SHALL validate existing prompts and connections for compatibility
6. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL load all provider configurations from the database into the registry

### Requirement 5: Model Capability Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define model capabilities so that the system can intelligently route prompts to appropriate models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining model capabilities THEN the system SHALL allow specification of context length, supported roles, system message support, streaming capability, and tool support
2. WHEN a model's capabilities are updated THEN the system SHALL validate existing prompts for compatibility and flag any issues
3. WHEN rendering prompts THEN the system SHALL use model capabilities to determine if a model can handle the specific prompt requirements
4. WHEN multiple models are available THEN the system SHALL recommend the most suitable model based on prompt characteristics and model capabilities
5. WHEN capabilities conflict with usage THEN the system SHALL display warnings and suggest alternative models
6. WHEN new capabilities are added THEN the system SHALL allow administrators to configure them for existing models

### Requirement 6: Provider Authentication Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different authentication methods for providers so that I can integrate with various API authentication schemes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring provider authentication THEN the system SHALL support API key, OAuth 2.0, AWS IAM, and custom header authentication methods
2. WHEN API keys are provided THEN the system SHALL encrypt and securely store all authentication credentials
3. WHEN OAuth is configured THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh and expiration automatically
4. WHEN AWS IAM is used THEN the system SHALL support both access key and IAM role-based authentication
5. WHEN custom authentication is needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of custom headers and authentication flows
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and provide clear error messages to administrators

### Requirement 7: Provider Template System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use provider templates so that I can quickly configure common providers without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new provider THEN the system SHALL offer templates for popular providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, etc.)
2. WHEN a template is selected THEN the system SHALL pre-populate configuration fields with appropriate defaults
3. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL allow customization of all fields while maintaining the base configuration
4. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of available updates for existing providers
5. WHEN custom providers are created THEN the system SHALL allow saving them as new templates for future use
6. WHEN templates include model lists THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch and populate available models

### Requirement 8: Provider Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor provider health so that I can proactively address issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providers are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically perform periodic health checks every 5 minutes
2. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL mark the provider as degraded and alert administrators
3. WHEN monitoring provider performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, error rates, and availability metrics
4. WHEN providers experience issues THEN the system SHALL automatically retry requests and implement circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN provider status changes THEN the system SHALL log the change and update the admin dashboard in real-time
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide provider performance analytics and usage statistics

### Requirement 9: Migration and Import/Export

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to export and import provider configurations so that I can backup settings and migrate between environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting configurations THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all provider and model definitions (excluding sensitive credentials)
2. WHEN importing configurations THEN the system SHALL validate the format and merge with existing providers without duplicates
3. WHEN migrating between environments THEN the system SHALL support bulk import of provider configurations with credential placeholders
