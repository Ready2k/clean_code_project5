# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Prompt Library is a universal, provider-agnostic system for creating, managing, and optimizing prompts that work across multiple AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, etc.). The system enables users to write prompts in human-friendly format, enhance them using LLMs, capture missing information through questionnaires, version and rate prompts, and export them in provider-specific formats. The core philosophy is spec-driven design with provider-agnostic storage and thin adapter layers for each provider.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Prompt Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a prompt engineer, I want to create and store prompts in a human-readable format, so that I can build a reusable library of prompts without being locked into a specific AI provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new prompt THEN the system SHALL store it in YAML format with metadata including title, summary, tags, and owner
2. WHEN a user creates a prompt THEN the system SHALL assign a unique UUID and slug for identification
3. WHEN a user saves a prompt THEN the system SHALL include version tracking with creation and update timestamps
4. WHEN a user defines prompt content THEN the system SHALL support human-readable sections including goal, audience, steps, and output expectations
5. WHEN a user creates a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow definition of variables with types (string, number, select, boolean) and required/optional flags

### Requirement 2: LLM-Powered Prompt Enhancement

**User Story:** As a prompt creator, I want to enhance my basic prompts using an LLM, so that I can automatically improve structure, add missing details, and optimize instructions according to best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests prompt enhancement THEN the system SHALL use an LLM agent to convert human-readable prompts into structured format
2. WHEN enhancement is performed THEN the system SHALL preserve the original intent and goal of the prompt
3. WHEN enhancement identifies missing information THEN the system SHALL generate specific questions to capture required variables
4. WHEN enhancement is complete THEN the system SHALL provide rationale explaining what changes were made and why
5. WHEN enhancement produces a structured prompt THEN the system SHALL include system instructions, user templates, rules, and variable definitions

### Requirement 3: Provider-Agnostic Rendering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert my prompts into provider-specific formats, so that I can use the same prompt across different AI services without manual conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a render for a specific provider THEN the system SHALL convert the structured prompt into that provider's native format
2. WHEN rendering for OpenAI THEN the system SHALL produce messages array with system and user roles
3. WHEN rendering for Anthropic THEN the system SHALL produce separate system and messages fields
4. WHEN rendering for Meta/Llama THEN the system SHALL produce appropriate message format for the model
5. WHEN rendering occurs THEN the system SHALL substitute all defined variables with their captured values
6. WHEN required variables are missing THEN the system SHALL prevent rendering and display helpful error messages

### Requirement 4: Variable Collection and Questionnaire System

**User Story:** As a prompt user, I want to be guided through providing missing information for prompts, so that I can easily complete prompts without needing to understand their internal structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt has undefined required variables THEN the system SHALL generate questions to collect the missing information
2. WHEN presenting questions THEN the system SHALL support different input types including string, number, select, multiselect, and boolean
3. WHEN a user answers questions THEN the system SHALL persist the answers with timestamps and user attribution
4. WHEN all required variables are collected THEN the system SHALL enable prompt rendering and export
5. WHEN optional variables are missing THEN the system SHALL allow rendering to proceed with default or empty values

### Requirement 5: Rating and Evaluation System

**User Story:** As a prompt library user, I want to rate and evaluate prompts, so that I can identify the most effective prompts and track their performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user rates a prompt THEN the system SHALL accept scores from 1 to 5 stars
2. WHEN a user rates a prompt THEN the system SHALL allow optional text notes explaining the rating
3. WHEN multiple users rate a prompt THEN the system SHALL calculate and display average ratings
4. WHEN displaying prompts THEN the system SHALL show aggregated rating information
5. WHEN a prompt is used THEN the system SHALL optionally log run metadata including provider, model, and outcome notes

### Requirement 6: Export and Download Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download prompts in provider-specific formats, so that I can integrate them directly into my applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests download THEN the system SHALL export the prompt in the selected provider's native JSON format
2. WHEN exporting for OpenAI THEN the system SHALL produce chat.completions API compatible JSON
3. WHEN exporting for Anthropic THEN the system SHALL produce Claude API compatible JSON
4. WHEN exporting for Meta THEN the system SHALL produce Llama-compatible message format
5. WHEN downloading THEN the system SHALL use naming convention: `<slug>_<provider>_v<version>.json`
6. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL perform variable substitution before generating the final format

### Requirement 7: Version Control and History

**User Story:** As a prompt maintainer, I want to track changes and versions of my prompts, so that I can maintain an audit trail and revert to previous versions if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a prompt is modified THEN the system SHALL create a new version with incremented version number
2. WHEN versioning occurs THEN the system SHALL record the change message, timestamp, and author
3. WHEN viewing prompt history THEN the system SHALL display all versions with their metadata
4. WHEN a prompt is enhanced or edited THEN the system SHALL maintain the complete version history
5. WHEN ratings are applied THEN the system SHALL associate them with specific prompt versions

### Requirement 8: Library Management and Organization

**User Story:** As a prompt library administrator, I want to organize and manage my prompt collection, so that I can efficiently find and maintain prompts across different categories and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the library THEN the system SHALL display prompts in grid or list format with title, tags, ratings, and last updated information
2. WHEN organizing prompts THEN the system SHALL support tagging with multiple tags per prompt
3. WHEN managing prompts THEN the system SHALL support status tracking (draft, active, archived)
4. WHEN searching prompts THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by status, tags, and other metadata
5. WHEN displaying prompts THEN the system SHALL show quick actions for enhance, render, and download operations

### Requirement 9: Data Storage and Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want prompt data to be stored reliably and portably, so that the library can be backed up, migrated, and accessed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing prompts THEN the system SHALL use filesystem-based storage with YAML format for human readability
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL use structured directory layout with prompts, renders, and specs folders
3. WHEN caching renders THEN the system SHALL store provider-specific versions separately with reference links
4. WHEN persisting data THEN the system SHALL support optional database indexing for performance and aggregation
5. WHEN storing sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt API keys and handle PII appropriately

### Requirement 10: User Interface and Experience
