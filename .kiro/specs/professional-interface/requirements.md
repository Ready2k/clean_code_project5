# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a professional web-based interface for the Prompt Library system. The interface will provide comprehensive management of LLM connections (supporting OpenAI and AWS Bedrock), user authentication, and full access to all prompt library functionality including prompt creation, enhancement, rendering, rating, and export capabilities. The interface aims to make the powerful prompt library system accessible to both technical and non-technical users through an intuitive, modern web application.

5. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL automatically log out and redirect to login page

### Requirement 3: Dashboard and Overview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an overview of my prompt library and system status so that I can quickly understand the current state and navigate to relevant sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display prompt library statistics, recent activity, and system health
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show total prompts, average ratings, provider status, and storage usage
3. WHEN a user clicks on dashboard widgets THEN the system SHALL navigate to the relevant detailed view
4. WHEN system issues exist THEN the system SHALL display alerts and notifications on the dashboard
5. WHEN the dashboard refreshes THEN the system SHALL update all statistics and status indicators in real-time

### Requirement 4: Prompt Library Management

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to create, edit, and organize prompts so that I can build a comprehensive library of reusable AI prompts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new prompt THEN the system SHALL provide a form with goal, audience, steps, and output expectations fields
2. WHEN a user saves a prompt THEN the system SHALL validate the content and store it with proper versioning
3. WHEN a user searches prompts THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by tags, owner, rating, and creation date
4. WHEN a user views a prompt THEN the system SHALL display human-readable content, metadata, variables, and version history
5. WHEN a user edits a prompt THEN the system SHALL create a new version and maintain the edit history
6. WHEN a user deletes a prompt THEN the system SHALL archive it and maintain referential integrity

### Requirement 5: AI Enhancement Workflow

**User Story:** As a prompt author, I want to enhance my prompts using AI so that I can improve their effectiveness and add missing details automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates prompt enhancement THEN the system SHALL send the prompt to the configured LLM service
2. WHEN enhancement is complete THEN the system SHALL display the enhanced version with rationale and confidence score
3. WHEN enhancement generates questions THEN the system SHALL present a questionnaire to gather missing information
4. WHEN a user answers questions THEN the system SHALL incorporate the answers into the prompt variables
5. WHEN a user approves enhancements THEN the system SHALL create a new structured version of the prompt
6. WHEN enhancement fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry with different settings

### Requirement 6: Multi-Provider Rendering

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to render prompts for different AI providers so that I can test and compare outputs across multiple models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a prompt for rendering THEN the system SHALL display available providers and models
2. WHEN a user configures render settings THEN the system SHALL allow temperature, model, and variable value adjustments
3. WHEN a user initiates rendering THEN the system SHALL generate provider-specific format and display preview
4. WHEN rendering is complete THEN the system SHALL show the formatted prompt and allow copying or downloading
5. WHEN variables are missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for required values before rendering
6. WHEN rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and suggest corrections

### Requirement 7: Rating and Evaluation System

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to rate and evaluate prompts so that we can identify the most effective prompts and improve our library quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a prompt THEN the system SHALL display current ratings and allow new rating submission
2. WHEN a user submits a rating THEN the system SHALL require a score (1-5) and optional notes
3. WHEN ratings are updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate average ratings and update displays
4. WHEN a user views rating history THEN the system SHALL show all ratings with timestamps and user information
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide rating analytics and trend analysis
6. WHEN filtering prompts THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by rating and filtering by rating ranges

### Requirement 8: Export and Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export prompts in various formats so that I can integrate them into my applications and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports a prompt THEN the system SHALL offer multiple format options (JSON, YAML, provider-specific)
2. WHEN export is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate the file with proper formatting and variable substitution
3. WHEN bulk export is requested THEN the system SHALL allow selection of multiple prompts and batch processing
4. WHEN API access is needed THEN the system SHALL provide REST endpoints for programmatic access
