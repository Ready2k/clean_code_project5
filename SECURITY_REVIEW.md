# Security Review Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the most critical security risks identified in the current codebase. Each issue includes an impact description, affected components, and recommended mitigations.

## Top Issues

1. **Default Administrative Credentials (High)**  
   *Description*: The system auto-creates an `admin` user with the hardcoded password `admin123456` whenever no admin exists. Anyone with network access to the authentication endpoints can immediately take over the environment if the default password is not changed before deployment.  
   *Evidence*: `initializeDefaultUser` seeds `admin@example.com` / `admin123456` and persists it to disk.【F:interface/backend/src/services/user-service.ts†L166-L190】  
   *Recommendation*: Remove hardcoded credentials. Require explicit, secure admin bootstrap via environment variables or a one-time setup flow that enforces strong, unique passwords.

2. **Predictable JWT Secret Fallback (High)**  
   *Description*: When `JWT_SECRET` is unset, both token issuance and verification fall back to the public string `"your-secret-key"`. Attackers can mint valid tokens or forge refresh tokens, gaining full control of authenticated APIs.  
   *Evidence*: `UserService` and `authenticateToken` both default to the same static secret when the environment variable is missing.【F:interface/backend/src/services/user-service.ts†L24-L33】【F:interface/backend/src/middleware/auth.ts†L16-L33】  
   *Recommendation*: Fail fast if `JWT_SECRET` is absent. Enforce strong, random secrets in configuration and prevent the application from starting without them.

3. **Server-Side Request Forgery in Prompt Import (High)**  
   *Description*: `/api/import/url` fetches arbitrary URLs supplied by authenticated users without allow-listing or protocol restrictions. This enables SSRF to internal services (e.g., metadata endpoints, AWS instance metadata) and can exfiltrate sensitive data.  
   *Evidence*: `importFromUrl` passes user-provided URLs directly to `fetch` after minimal validation.【F:interface/backend/src/controllers/import.ts†L112-L158】  
   *Recommendation*: Restrict imports to trusted domains or signed sources, enforce protocol allow-lists, and add network-layer protections (e.g., SSRF proxy, URL validation with DNS/IP checks).

4. **Log File Path Traversal (High)**  
   *Description*: The log viewing API accepts a `filename` path segment and joins it directly with the logs directory. Attackers with the `system:config` permission can request `../../../../etc/passwd` (or similar) and read arbitrary files accessible to the process.  
   *Evidence*: `getLogFileContent` forwards unsanitized filenames to `logReaderService.readLogFile`, which uses `path.join` without enforcing directory boundaries.【F:interface/backend/src/controllers/system.ts†L300-L333】【F:interface/backend/src/services/log-reader-service.ts†L83-L125】  
   *Recommendation*: Normalize and validate filenames, reject path traversal sequences, and maintain an allow-list of known log files before reading from disk.

5. **Unauthenticated Log Ingestion Enables Log Forgery / DoS (Medium)**  
   *Description*: The `/api/v1/logs/frontend` and `/api/v1/logs/frontend/batch` endpoints allow anyone to submit arbitrary log messages that are written to server log files. An attacker can flood storage, obscure true audit events, or inject misleading log entries.  
   *Evidence*: Log ingestion routes are exposed without authentication and forward request bodies straight into the logger.【F:interface/backend/src/routes/logs.ts†L7-L115】  
   *Recommendation*: Require authentication and rate limiting for log ingestion, validate message content, and cap total log volume accepted from clients.

## Remediation Priorities

1. **Eliminate hardcoded admin credentials** – Block default account creation and enforce secure bootstrap procedures.
2. **Enforce secure JWT configuration** – Require strong secrets and abort startup if `JWT_SECRET` is missing.
3. **Harden URL import workflow** – Implement strict SSRF defenses (domain allow-listing, protocol filtering, and metadata IP blocking).
4. **Sanitize log file access paths** – ✅ Completed by enforcing allow-listed filenames and centralized path validation.
5. **Protect log ingestion endpoints** – ✅ Completed with authentication, throttling, and payload validation middleware.

## Verification of Remediations (Latest Release)

The latest code pulled from the public Git repository (tagged as the most recent release at the time of this review) was re-examined specifically for remediation items **4** and **5**. Both vulnerabilities are now mitigated:

* **Log file path traversal blocked** – `LogReaderService` validates requested filenames against a cached allow-list and ensures the resolved path stays within the logs directory, preventing traversal attacks.【F:interface/backend/src/services/log-reader-service.ts†L1-L120】【F:interface/backend/src/utils/path-security.ts†L1-L53】
* **Frontend log ingestion locked down** – `/api/v1/logs/frontend` and `/api/v1/logs/frontend/batch` now require authentication, enforce per-route rate limiting, and validate payload structure before writing to the server logs, eliminating the unauthenticated ingestion vector.【F:interface/backend/src/routes/logs.ts†L1-L116】【F:interface/backend/src/middleware/log-ingestion.ts†L1-L74】

### Follow-up Verification (Latest Push `56d3939b7d81`)

Re-validating the newest commit (`56d3939b7d81`) confirms the fixes remain in place: the path security utility still defends against traversal attempts and the log ingestion routes retain their authentication, throttling, and validation layers.【F:interface/backend/src/services/log-reader-service.ts†L1-L120】【F:interface/backend/src/utils/path-security.ts†L1-L53】【F:interface/backend/src/routes/logs.ts†L1-L116】【F:interface/backend/src/middleware/log-ingestion.ts†L1-L74】

Addressing these items in priority order will significantly reduce the risk of compromise or misuse when the application is deployed.
